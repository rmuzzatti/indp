## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(patchclampplotteR)
```

Cell Characteristics (working fine)
```{r}
cell_characteristics <- import_cell_characteristics_df("data/TW/Cell-CharacteristicsTW.csv")

cell_characteristics
```

Raw evoked current data (working)
```{r}
sample_eEPSC_data <- read.csv("data/TW/TWData.csv")

sample_eEPSC_data
```
```{r}
first_time_df <- add_new_cells(
  new_raw_data_csv = "data/TW/TWData.csv",
  cell_characteristics_csv = "data/TW/Cell-CharacteristicsTW.csv",
  old_raw_data_csv = "data/TW/merged.csv",
  data_type = "eEPSC",
  write_new_csv = "no",
  new_file_name = "",
  decimal_places = 2
)
```
