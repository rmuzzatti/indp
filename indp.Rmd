## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(patchclampplotteR)
library(dplyr)
```

Cell Characteristics (all)
```{r}
cell_characteristics <- import_cell_characteristics_df("data/Cell-Characteristics.csv")

cell_characteristics
```

Raw evoked current data (RM)
```{r}
raw_eEPSC_df <- read.csv("data/rraw-eEPSC.csv")
```

To automatically append new data onto your existing sheet and save as new csv to data subfolder
```{r eval=FALSE}
add_new_cells(
  new_raw_data_csv = "data/RM/RMData.csv",
  cell_characteristics_csv = "data/Cell-Characteristics.csv",
  old_raw_data_csv = "data/rraw-eEPSC.csv",
  data_type = "eEPSC",
  write_new_csv = "yes",
  new_file_name = "data/rraw-eEPSC.csv",
  decimal_places = 2
)
```

```{r}
raw_eEPSC_df %>%
  filter(category == 5) %>%
  filter(time == 0) %>%
 group_by(treatment) %>%
  count(sex) %>%
  arrange(treatment, sex)
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
add_new_cells(
  new_raw_data_csv = "data/Raw-eEPSC-naive.csv",
  cell_characteristics_csv = "data/Cell-Characteristics.csv",
  old_raw_data_csv = "data/rraw-eEPSC.csv",
  data_type = "eEPSC",
  write_new_csv = "yes",
  new_file_name = "data/rraw-eEPSC.csv",
  decimal_places = 2
)
```
